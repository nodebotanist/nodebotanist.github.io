This is my personal site-- I am hacking up a fake terminal to use with [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org). I will be splitting out the functionality into its own xterm plugin as a side project.

## TODO list:

- [*] add subcommand to help to allow users to search help text for each command
  - [*] refactor commands to have a helpText property and a run function
- [ ] add in cli-table2
- [ ] GitHub support with Octokit
